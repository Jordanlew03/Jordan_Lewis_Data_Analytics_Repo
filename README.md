## Overview

This repository is dedicated to showcasing different data analytics projects, automation processes, and scripts. The projects cover a wide range of data analytics topics, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), automation models, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Resume and LinkedIn: I have attached my resume and LinkedIn profile
- Ethics Statements: Due to the increase in the use of AI and automation, I wanted to share some ethics issues and how to tackle those problems
- Certificates and Badges: Collection of certificates and badges I have earned along the way
- Data analysis project –Excel & Minitab: Using Excel and Minitab, I was able to explore the relationship between abortion rates, medium household income, and unemployment rates over time in the United States and test my hypothesis 
- Data preparation and visualization project – Tableau Prep and Tableau: Using Tableau Prep builder and Tableau Desktop, I was able to create insightful visualizations about gun crime and background checks in the United States
- Database management tasks using SQL & Python in Jupyter Notebook: Using SQL I was able to properly prepare a dataset on Life Expectancy around the world and visualize it using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- Portfolio compilation and presentation: Using Microsoft Azure and Excel, I was able to analyze and create solutions for a business’s HR department on their job performance data. 
- Python Files: A small compilation of Python code ran through Anaconda

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Abortion Rates and Medium Household Income Across the United States Analysis in Minitab and Excel

Description: This project focuses on the study of abortion rates, median household income, and unemployment rates in the United States over time and their relationship to each other. It involves Minitab statistical tools and Excel for data prep and cleaning, one-way ANOVA test, Tukey Comparison, and multi-regression test and techniques, and discovered that abortion rates and medium household income had no correlation but abortion rates and unemployment rates do have a relationship to each other.

### Project 2: Gun Background Checks and Gun Crime Rates in the United States over time using Tableau Prep Builder and Tableau 

Description: This project delves into an analysis of background checks for guns in the United States and its relationship to gun crime. It utilizes Tableau Prep to clean and prepare data, Tableau to visualize the data, and to find out that gun crime and background checks have little to no relationship with each other.

Files:
- Final_Project.tflix: Tableau File showing analysis and visualizations
- firearmdata.csv: Dataset utilized in the project



### Project 3: Database Management for Life Expectancy Data Across the World Using SQL, Juypter Notebook, and Python

Description: This project focuses on the study of Life Expectancy around the world and it’s multiple factors. It involves various SQL statements and Python code for data prep and cleaning and visualizations. Through analysis, we were able to  discovered multiple relationships surrounding life expectancy.

- FinalReport_SP23_JL_CS.ipynb: Detailed report outlining methodology and results
- life_expec.csv: Dataset of life expectancy used in the project
  government_data: Dataset that was used for join, government data




### Project 4: MS Azure HR Job Performance Analysis 

Description: This project focuses on the usage of MS Azure and Data Explorer and KQL to clean data and use it for analysis and create solutions and visualizations. Through analysis and visualizations, I made a couple suggestions for this business to improve job performance and job satisfaction scores.

- MS Azure Analysis_ Job Attrition and Satisfaction- Jordan Lewis.pptx: A slide deck of my findings
- WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition (1).csv: Dataset for my analysis


### Project 5: Python Files and Scripts

Description: This folder is a compliation of coding files in Python I made to address the prompt at hand. 

Files: 
- Fav_quote.py: a few lines of code allowing the user to put in their favorite quote and name and the code properly formats the sentence
- quadratic_formula.py: a few lines of code allowing the user to put in their own numbers for the quadratic formula and the code outputs the answer
- tag_hopscotch.py: code properly sorting out a list of kids in a class and outputs what activity they would like to play
- wk4_zylab_registration: code properly sorting out which people should go into what line a list of people will go in based on their registration status
- wk7_store_sales: code that calulates a stores sales
